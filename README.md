## Requirements

1. Choose a theme for your game!
2. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
3. Display the following on the page:
- Press any key to get started!
- Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
- If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
- As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _  _ a.
4. Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
5. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
6. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
